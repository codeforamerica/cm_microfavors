Hello,

Code for America is running a trial program to help job seekers out who may not have the means to travel to a resume workshop or receive personalized employment assistance.

Would you be willing to help a local job seeker? We estimate this would only need 2 to 15 minutes of your time.

If so, please follow this link to our Microfavors project.

Kind regards,

Kimberly, Paras, and Mike
